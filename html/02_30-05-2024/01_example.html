       <b>HTML</b> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as <em><u>interactive</u></em>
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as <mark>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items</mark>. HTML elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  directly introduce content into the
        page. Other tags such as block surround and provide information about document text and may include <s>sub-element</s>
        tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
